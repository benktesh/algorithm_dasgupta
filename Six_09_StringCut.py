'''
#   A certain string-processing language offers a primitive operation which splits a string into two
#   pieces. Since this operation involves copying the original string, it takes n units of time for a
#   string of length n, regardless of the location of the cut. Suppose, now, that you want to break a
#   string into many pieces. The order in which the breaks are made can affect the total running
#   time. For example, if you want to cut a 20-character string at positions 3 and 10, then making
#   the rst cut at position 3 incurs a total cost of 20 + 17 = 37, while doing position 10 rst has a
#   better cost of 20 + 10 = 30.
#   Give a dynamic programming algorithm that, given the locations of m cuts in a string of length
#   n, nds the minimum cost of breaking the string into m+ 1 pieces.


    Solution Description:
 
'''
def splitString(X, m):
    pass


def main():
    X = "OldSite:GeeksforGeeks.org"
    pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    sys.exit(int(main() or 0))
